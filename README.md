# CSS 342 Data Structures, Algorithms, and Discrete Mathematics I  
This repository provides an overview of a series of programming assignments completed in CSS 342, focusing on class design, recursion, linked lists, sorting algorithms, and queue/BST applications in C++.  

## üìñ Project Overviews

### Program 1: Class Design and Operator Overloading  
This project exercises abstraction, encapsulation, and operator overloading concepts through two designs:  
- VendingBank: A class modeling a coin-operated vending bank (header-only design).  
- TimeSpan: A fully implemented class representing durations with hours, minutes, and seconds, supporting arithmetic and comparison operators along with I/O overloading.  
Key learning includes normalized time storage, operator design, and unit testing strategies.

### Program 2: Recursion and Pathfinding  
Two programming tasks illustrating recursion:  
- Catalan Numbers: Recursive calculation of the nth Catalan number, handling inputs via command line with graceful error checking.  
- Greedy Robot: Finds all unique shortest paths in a 2D grid under constraints on consecutive moves in the same direction.  
This project emphasizes recursion fundamentals, command line argument handling, and path enumeration logic.

### Program 3: Templated Linked Lists  
Develops a fully ordered templated linked list class `List342` supporting dynamic memory, file input, and operator overloading:  
- Insert, remove, peek, merge, and display operations with duplicate prevention.  
- Tested with int, string, and custom object types.  
- Implements deep copy, equality checking, and STL-like syntax compatibilities.  
This reinforces mastery of templates, pointers, copy constructors, and linked list design.

### Program 4: Sorting Algorithm Runtime Comparisons  
Compares runtime performance of multiple sorting algorithms on integer vectors ranging from small to very large sizes:  
- Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Shell Sort, Iterative Merge Sort.  
- Performance visualization using Excel graphs with trendline analysis.  
- Observations on runtime consistency and algorithmic complexity behavior.  
This highlights empirical algorithm analysis and graphical data reporting.

### Program 5: The Jolly Banker ‚Äì Queue and BST Application  
Implements a banking system processing transactions with queues and storing clients/accounts in a binary search tree:  
- Supports open account, deposit, withdrawal, transfer, and transaction history retrieval operations.  
- Effective error handling for invalid transactions and overdraws using linked funds logic.  
- Employs a queue for transaction ordering and a BSTree for fast account retrieval.  
This project deepens understanding of data structure usage in real-world scenarios and robust program design.
